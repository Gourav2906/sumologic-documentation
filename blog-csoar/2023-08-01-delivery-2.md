We are excited to announce the release of a new version of Cloud SOAR. Delivery 2 offers the following enhancements over our initial Cloud SOAR product:

* New and improved features:
   * Dashboards
   * Reports
 * Open Integration Framework updates:
    * Integration Builder allows you to build integrations without needing to provide code
    * Certified integrations allow you to customize JSON and table output schema
    * Actions configuration during playbook design is rearranged for easier use
    * Integrations, and related action execution, can be done in the cloud or through the Bridge. Only certified integrations can be executed in the cloud.
* Architectural improvements:
     * Fully-functional in the Cloud (the Bridge is only required for custom integrations)
     * User and profile management is in Sumo Logic core platform instead of Cloud SOAR
     * Automatic scalability based on server load
